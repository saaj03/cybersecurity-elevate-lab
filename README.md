## Objectives
- Identify and document all installed browser extensions.
- Evaluate publisher, source, and permissions for each extension.
- Remove or restrict risky extensions.
- Apply browser security best practices.

## Inventory
| Name                 | Publisher | Source           | Permissions                   | Status   | Decision |
|----------------------|-----------|------------------|--------------------------------|----------|----------|
| Google Docs Offline  | Google    | Chrome Web Store | Edit/create/view docs offline | Enabled  | Keep     |
| React Developer Tools| Meta      | Chrome Web Store | React debugging tools         | Enabled  | Keep     |

## Steps Performed
1. Opened Chrome extensions page (`chrome://extensions/`).
2. Captured **before** screenshot of installed extensions.
3. Created `extensions_inventory.csv` with extension details.
4. Checked for unknown publishers, suspicious permissions, and unused extensions.
5. No suspicious extensions found â€” all from trusted sources.
6. No removals required; took **after** screenshot.
7. Recommended enabling auto-updates and installing only from official stores.

## Observations
- Both extensions are essential and from verified publishers.
- Permissions are minimal and relevant to their purpose.
- Browser performance remains unaffected.

## Conclusion
No security risks detected. Extensions are safe and necessary. Regular audits help maintain browser security.
